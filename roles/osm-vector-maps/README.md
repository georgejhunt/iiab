## What's Changed in Maps for the IIAB 7.2 Release?
1. Two variables in /etc/local_vars have new meanings:
    1. Osm_vector_maps_install means install the map program (about 40MB).
    2. Osm_vector_maps_installed means install a functioning world map to zoom 10 (about 2.8GB). 
2. There is a new installer page, separate from the Admin Console, with installs regions and downloads higher resolution satellite imagery from zoom 11 to zoom 13 (16 times the resolution provided by zoom 10j).
3. Multiple vector OpenStreetMap regions may be installed, and viewed on the same map.
4. Multiple regions of satellite improvements can be added to the same map.
1. The region size for satellite downloads can be adjusted to 50, 150, or 500KM around a selected map point.
1. More recent OSM data is used in the vector tiles (2017 => 2019).
4. Increase the base install  (world view) from zoom 9 to 10, so that city search is successful more of the time.
5. There is a new drag and drop feature which permits the student to add descriptions and pictres about local points of interest, and then save and restore them using their local browser.
